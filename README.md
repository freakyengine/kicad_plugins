# KiCad Plugins

Collection of self-made KiCad plugins.

## Track Arc Generator

This plugin creates arc tracks based on multiple small segments. Track parameters like net or width are applied to the created arc.

1. Select/Highlight two track segments
2. Execute the plugin by clicking the button
3. Enter (modify) the arc radius and segment count based on your needs
4. Take a look on you new arc track!

Currently, the script does not check, if the arc radius fits the selected trace lengths.

## Installation

Copy the desired plugin folder into KiCads plugin directory and restart KiCad.
